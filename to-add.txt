I am Surajkant Singh. Or, just SK, for those who dont wanna butcher my name. I was born and brought up in Banmore, Madhya Pradesh. I was always interested in coding and programming but being a teacher, I never got the chance or time to start learning it properly. As the schools closed because of the lockdown, I started learning web development, then I moved out to search for a job and currently, I am working as a front end web developer in Noida, Uttar Pradesh. I am still learning everyday and wish to become a fullstack developer soon.
